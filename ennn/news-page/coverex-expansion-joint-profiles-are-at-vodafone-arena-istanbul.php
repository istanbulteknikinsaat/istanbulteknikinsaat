<h3>The most appropriate profiles according to the statics of the structure</h3>
<p>Vodafone Arena, which has a big mass structure, also had expansion dilatational axes according to the building static. Istanbul Teknik system specialists started to work after the briefing they received from Vodafone Arena Site Management, on how to close the existing gaps vertically and horizontally by expansion joint profiles suitable for existing coatings. Another issue where Istanbul Teknik’s technical experts had to provide a solution for the project was to determine the proper profiles for filling the joint gaps in the reverse entrances. As a result of the static works, the solutions that meet the requirements and the aesthetics of the construction were produced. After Vodafone Arena Construction Site Management approved the solutions provided by Istanbul Teknik the Project implementation started.
