<h3>Fields of Application and Usage</h3>
<ul class="subpage-full-list">
    <li>Increases the ground bearing strength of the buildings to be built on soft and poor grounds.</li>
    <li>Since it creates low elongation under high tensile strength, it is used as a reinforcing layer in the roads. It minimizes the deformations such as undermining caused by uniform subsidence and vehicle wheels.</li>
    <li>It prevents interference of the sub-base materials with the ground, keeps the load-carrying capacity and minimizes the loss of material used in the filling.</li>
    <li>By absorbing a portion of the load and creating a force in the opposite direction at the edge of the area where a local collapse has been occurred, prevents the degradation of the ground especially in road constructions.</li>
    <li>While geogrid-reinforced GeoArme structures are recommended especially in slope stability, woven geotextiles can also be used. This application prevents the loss of soil in case of flooding.</li>
